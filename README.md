</p>  
This programme is a lightweight, open-source and userfriendly tool to keep an eye on overtimes at work. It calculates - based on attendance times the user entered - how many hours of working time the user accumulated and visualises the balance so that he always is up to date. If used consequently one can save precious free time and organize working time in a way that employees and bosses might profit from. 

### installation
<p>
<ul>
<li>1.	download the current package</li>
<li>2.	unzip it to any destination you want</li>

There is no installation tool needed and the programme won't create any files to another directory. That means, that you can easily copy the programme folder to another computer and use it there without installation needed. If there is no binary for your OS check out the last paragraph "compile or edit the project", where you can find information on how to compile the project.

### open source
This programme is open source. That means you can use it freely and distribute it under the terms of GPLv3.
